**Colorectal Cancer Drug Response Prediction**


**Problem Statement**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide.
Chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains a standard treatment, yet response rates vary widely, some patients benefit significantly, while others suffer toxicity without real therapeutic gain.Despite advances, predicting which patients will respond to 5-FU remains a key challenge in oncology.


There is a critical need for predictive models that can identify patients who are most likely to respond to 5-FU based on their clinical and molecular (gene expression) profiles. Such models could guide oncologists in personalizing chemotherapy regimens, improving survival outcomes, and minimizing unnecessary toxicity.
