**Colorectal Cancer Drug Response Prediction**


**Problem Statement**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide.
Chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) remains a standard treatment, yet response rates vary widely, some patients benefit significantly, while others suffer toxicity without real therapeutic gain.Despite advances, predicting which patients will respond to different drugs
fluorouracil(5-FU), oxaliplatin, folfox(oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil) remains a key challenge in oncology.


There is a critical need for predictive models that can identify patients who are most likely to respond to 5-FU based on their clinical and molecular (gene expression) profiles. Such models could guide oncologists in personalizing chemotherapy regimens, improving survival outcomes, and minimizing unnecessary toxicity.

Causal Machine Learning(ML) can improve help us understand the effects of treatment interventions; hence improving the accuracy and intepretability of models. We can use causal effects to identify how patients and disease characteristics influence the treatment effectiveness.
